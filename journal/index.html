            <h1>Images and Fancy Annimations</h1>
            <p>I think it was really interesting seeing the animations that were added to the website <a href="https://brewdistrict24.com/en">https://brewdistrict24.com/en</a>. The website features a beer can that rotates down the page as you scroll while lining up with different frames throughout the page. I thought this was really interesting because the animation seems really clean. A lot of the time, it feels like some websites overdo it to show off fancy animation skills, but this one feels really purposeful.</p>

            <p>I also think the article that was talking about visual thinking skills with analyzing the photographs was really interesting. I was slightly annoyed by the fact that the website didn't include more information about the images so that you could see if you had guessed what was going on correctly, but it really made me think more about the context behind each image I see.</p>

            <h1>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h1>
            <p>Overlays and lightboxes help solve the design challenge of how to convey more information without losing the content of the current screen. The article explains how its important to focus on the five W's ( who, What, When , Where, and Why) when deciding if an overlay is the right design solution. Its important to consider who your audience is and how the users actions will be influenced by the layout. Focusing on the experience for mobile users is another important part of tailoring the layout, Ensuring visibility and accessibility for various devices and screen resolutions. Making the desired action the user is supposed to take is the next step. </p>
